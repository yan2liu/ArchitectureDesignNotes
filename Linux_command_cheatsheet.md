$ grep 'new_whale$' train.csv > new_whale.csv

- Select each line of string from query_str.csv, and find match line in table.csv, output to matched_table.csv
$ grep -f query_str.csv table.csv > matched_table.csv

- [Delete all lines end with String ('new_wale') from one file (origin.csv) & write result to a new file (known_wales.csv)] (http://www.theunixschool.com/2012/06/sed-25-examples-to-delete-line-or.html)
$ sed '/new_wale$/d' origin.csv > known_wales.csv

- Replace ',5004' with ',-1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0' in file new_whale_with_neg_one_id.csv
$ sed -i 's/,5004/,-1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0/g' new_whale_with_neg_one_id.csv

- Parse csv file with ',' (or ' ') as delimiter, choose  the '2' column to output file(second_col.csv). 
$ cut -d , -f 2 comma.csv > second_col.csv

- Merge two files into one file with  each line as first file concatenate to second file & seperate by ','
$ paste -d , first.csv second.csv

- Select id, count(id) from ids.csv, output as id,count format
$ sort ids.csv | uniq -c | awk '{printf("%s,%s\n",$2,$1)}' > id_occurence_count.csv 

- Count total number of difference between two files.
$ diff --suppress-common-lines --speed-large-files -y File1 File2 | wc -l

- Take first 858 lines to new file:
$ head -858 total.csv >> first_858.csv

- Merge two files into one, one after another
$ cat end.csv >> begin.csv
