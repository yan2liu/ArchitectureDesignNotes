# Consideration related to System Design:

- 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗼𝗳𝗳𝘀: it's essential to identify the main features it should have. This involves understanding the requirements and prioritising certain aspects over others.
- 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: Systems deal with different types of data, such as structured (e.g., SQL tables), semi-structured (e.g., JSON documents), and unstructured (e.g., images or blobs). Understanding the characteristics and requirements of the data is essential for making design decisions, such as choosing the appropriate database or storage solutions.
- 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 : Analysing user behaviour and characteristics helps design systems that effectively cater to their needs. Identifying user types (e.g., admins, regular users) allows for role-based access control and personalised experiences. Understanding peak usage times, user growth rates, and geographical distribution help scale the system and optimise performance.
- 𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴: Caching plays a crucial role in improving system performance. Understanding caching strategies and implementing them can enhance system efficiency.
- 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀: Modern APIs have evolved to become essential building blocks for creating modular and scalable architectures. Familiarity with API design principles, standards, and technologies is valuable for designing robust and interoperable systems.
- 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘅𝗶𝗲𝘀: Proxies, particularly load balancers acting as reverse proxies, are essential for distributing incoming requests across multiple servers. The key considerations are to choose the right load-balancing algorithm (e.g., round-robin, least connections) appropriate for the system's requirements.
- 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆: Understanding the resource requirements of the system is crucial for provisioning servers
- 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲𝘀: Messaging queues enable asynchronous communication between nodes in a distributed system. They decouple the sender and receiver, allowing independent operation of nodes.
- 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: Ensuring high availability is crucial for mission-critical systems. When using micro services, designing fault-tolerant systems becomes crucial to prevent cascading failures. Tools like Kubernetes can aid in managing micro services and achieving fault tolerance.
When it comes to cracking interviews and succeeding in a technical career, having a strong understanding of system design is must
