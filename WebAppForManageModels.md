# A Web Application for Managing ML Models in Docker

## Build a platform for Manage & Run ML models & data

### Use Case

* ML Model Experts:
  ->Build Model with common libraries & platform 
      -> Train 
          -> Validate & Test 
              -> Wrapper in Docker Image 
                  -> Upload to Docker Repo for release

* Web Framework Server Developers:
  ->Pull all docker Images from Docker Repo
      -> Show docker image & description on the Web Page 
          -> Provide input parameter form based on Json Schema in docker image 
              -> Upload & Manage Dataset
                  -> Run dockers with data & parameters
                      -> Pull log & generated data & clean docker containers

 * Model Users:
  -> Browser models in Web Server
      -> Upload/Select dataset & configure parameter for selected model
          -> Run model by the Web Server
              -> View Model Results by the Web Server

* Model/Web Administrators:
  -> Evaluate models based on models' result
      -> Request Model experts to fine-tune model with new data if model result deteriorate 

### Design Thoughts
* Seperate of Concerns
* Platform Independent
* Same for edge & cloud

### Implementation with Python
* Use Fask & related library to build web server backend
  - Flask Web server http://flask.pocoo.org/
  - WS Rest Mapping with Flask-RESTPlus https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/example.html
  - ORM with Flask-SQLAlchemy http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/

* Use Polymer or AngularJS to build web server frontend. Both from google & widely used.
  - Polymer https://www.polymer-project.org/
  - AngularJS https://angular.io/

* Docker SDK for Python
  - https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html
  - https://github.com/docker/docker-py

* TensorFlow Docker Image for building ML model:
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/

* Database options
  - PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/
  - SQLite for small,simple, embedded DB https://www.sqlite.org/index.html

### Implemenation with Java 
* User Spring Framework/Spring Boot. It include whole sets to build web server backend, including wrapping for Hibernate as ORM https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/

* Java API client for docker https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java
